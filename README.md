Project Overview:

In this project, we explore the correlation between web interest, as reflected in Google Trends and Reddit Crypto Forum data, and the value of various cryptocurrencies in USD.

Cryptocurrencies Analyzed:

Bitcoin (BTC)
Litecoin (LTC)
Cardano (ADA)
Dogecoin (DOGE)
XRP (XRP)
Binance Coin (BNB)
Web Interest Definition:

Google Trends API: We used this API to obtain the search frequency of specific terms and queries over time. For each cryptocurrency, we considered both the real name (e.g., 'Bitcoin') and the traded symbol (e.g., 'BTC'). The average of these values was used as the trend score.

Reddit Crypto Forum: We collected data from posts and discussions about each cryptocurrency. Sentiment analysis was conducted to determine if the general sentiment towards a cryptocurrency affects its value in USD.

Project Goals:

Compare the selected cryptocurrencies to determine which, if any, are more influenced by web interest.
Identify which cryptocurrencies are more robust against the impact of online search trends and discussions.
Scope:

The trends were analyzed over time and across different geographic locations.
